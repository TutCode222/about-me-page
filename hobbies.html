<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<br>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Singing:</strong> In my younger years, I used to write and sing a lot. It was very freeing. <b></b>
        I'm hoping to get back to doing that more often.</li>

    <li><strong>Creative activities:</strong> I've had several projects that I've started and I'm hoping to <b></b>
        complete them all this year.</li>

    <li><strong>Cooking for loved ones:</strong>Feeding my family is one of my love languages.</li>

    <li><strong>Shopping:</strong> Lately I've mostly been window shopping for myself as it's baseball season. <b></b>
        But I have my eyes on this pair of shoes that will be mine soon!ðŸ˜Ž</li>

    <li><strong>Watching movies with my son:</strong> There is nothing I love more than putting on pjs, getting upder a cozy blanket with snacks and finding a good moview to watch with my kiddo. I often wish I could live in those moments forever with him.</li>
